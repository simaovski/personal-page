Generally, the text on these pages has a broad description of personal accomplishments, such as graduation or travel dates, and summarizes your history.<br /><br />I recommend that you write one or two paragraphs about yourself. For ease of writing, consider this to be your cover letter to your visitor. Add relevant information here, okay?<br/><br/>Well, to add information on this page you should use a bit of HTML. It's not hard at all, but it can be a bit confusing. If you want to add some spacing between the paragraphs you should use the code &lt;br /&gt;. This code is known as \"break line\" and every time you use it will be broken a line."
